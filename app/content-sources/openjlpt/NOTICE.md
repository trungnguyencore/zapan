## Important note on JLPT levels

The Japan Foundation / JLPT organisation does **not** publish official N5–N1 vocabulary or
kanji lists. The current N5–N1 groupings in this project are derived from **Jonathan
Waller's community-standard lists**. They are widely used and reliable, but are
*unofficial approximations* of the real (undisclosed) test content. KANJIDIC2's own `jlpt`
field refers to the **pre-2010 four-level system (1–4)** and is intentionally **not** used
for level assignment here.

## Data freshness

Per the EDRDG license, projects redistributing this data should keep it reasonably current.
OpenJLPT regenerates from upstream on a scheduled basis; see `.github/workflows/`.
